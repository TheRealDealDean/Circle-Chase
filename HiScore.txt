HiScore:

The HighScore will be displayed in the top right corner of the screen like so: "HiScore: 000000" only displaying the exact integers and NOT Zefilling empty integers on screen.
The HighScore will be displayed again in the centre of the screen at the end of each game ontop of the "Restart Button" if the HighScore has not been surpassed.
If the HighScore has been surpassed, then neither the Highscore nor the Score for the recently ended game will be displayed on the restart screen; instead, "New HiScore: 000000" will be displayed ontop of the "Restart Button."
