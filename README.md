# Circle-Chase
A game in which the player attempts to avoid being caught by the AI circle.
Controls are UpArrow = Up | DownArrow = Down | LeftArrow = Left | RightArrow = Right | SpaceBar = Change Colours
As the player, your goal is to evade the AI controlled circle for as long as possible.
During this time, you will see a timer in the top left corner that will represent how long you have survived.
Each interval of 50 seconds the AI circle will increase in speed by .5% of it's current speed until you have survived for 500 seconds; the Player's speed will increase too, but only by 0.125%.
At 250 seconds, other obstacles will start to appear on screen for you to avoid.
Obstacles will appear more frequently until you survive for 9999 seconds at which point the game will automatically reset.
Obstacles can be used to your advantage, and can block the AI controlled circle if you navigate properly.
After the end of each game, you will be met with a "GAME OVER" title, a note of your previous highscore compared to your most recent score, and the option to "Start Over."
